# Transfer Learning for Image Classification
### CellStrat AI Lab Presentation

Transfer learning (TL) is a research problem in machine learning that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could apply when trying to recognize trucks.

This repository applies Image Classification on the classic Dogs vs Cats Dataset in three ways to compare results:
* Image Classification from Scratch
* Transfer Learning by Feature Extraction
* Transfer Learning by Fine-Tuning
